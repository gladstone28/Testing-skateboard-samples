Testing skateboard samples for safety and quality assurance is crucial to ensure they are durable, stable, and safe for users. Here are the typical tests performed on skateboard samples:

1. Impact Resistance Test
- This test evaluates how well the skateboard can withstand shocks and impacts, such as from jumps or rough landings. The skateboard deck is typically dropped from a set height with weights, simulating the force exerted during high-impact activities.
2. Static Load Test
- A static load test places a fixed weight on the deck to assess its strength under steady pressure. This test checks if the deck can bear the maximum weight without cracking or deforming.
3. Fatigue or Flexural Test
- In this test, the skateboard is subjected to repeated bending or flexing to simulate real-life usage. The test assesses the durability and elasticity of the deck, ensuring it doesn't weaken or break over time.
4. Wheel Hardness and Grip Test
- This test measures the hardness of the wheels (using a durometer) and the grip they provide. Wheels must balance hardness for durability and softness for smooth rides and grip, preventing slippage.
5. Truck Strength Test
- Trucks, which connect the wheels to the board, are tested for both strength and flexibility. They must withstand lateral and vertical forces without bending or breaking, ensuring that they can endure high-stress conditions like sharp turns or flips.
6. Bearing Durability Test
- Bearings are tested under friction and rotation to ensure they provide smooth and sustained motion without quickly wearing out. A high-speed spin test is common to check their performance over time.
7. Slip Resistance (Grip Tape) Test
- Grip tape, which provides traction, is tested to confirm it has sufficient friction to prevent slipping during use. This test often involves measuring the coefficient of friction on the deck surface.
8. Environmental Exposure Test
- Boards are exposed to conditions like humidity, water, and temperature changes to check for warping, splitting, or material degradation. This test is particularly important for wooden or bamboo skateboards that may be affected by moisture.
9. Surface Deflection Test
- The deck is subjected to stress to measure its ability to withstand bending or flexing. This helps in ensuring that the board has the right amount of flexibility without causing instability.

These tests help manufacturers certify that skateboards meet safety standards, making them safe for users, and comply with regulations and guidelines from organizations like ASTM or ISO for sports equipment.
